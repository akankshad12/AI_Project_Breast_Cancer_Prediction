Breast Cancer Prediction is very important as the rate of women affected by this disease is increasing. So, in this project Prediction is performed using KNN algorithm which is a Machine Learning algorithm. Following are the software and libraries which needs to be installed for running this project.
•	Install PyCharm community version (PyCharm Community Edition 2018.2.4). https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows 
•	Install Python 3.4.6 
•	Install libraries as follows: numpy (pip install numpy 1.11.0 or later), sklearn (pip install sklearn), pandas (pip install pandas), matplotlib (pip install matplotlib), flask( pip install flask).
•	Install PyQt4 and PyQt5, PyQt4 - Download zip PyQt4-4.11.4-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ After installing this .whl file use the command. 
•	PyQt5- https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5
•	Run model.py (You will see the results on a webpage. As html is used for displaying the result.) This file is the main file which shows the accuracy of the model and also the results.
•	Run Graph.py (You will see the output graph on python console using PyQt4 and PyQt5). This file shows the decision boundary analysis of the results. The benign and malignant points on the graph are displayed.
